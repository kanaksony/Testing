There's more duplication of work in big companies. In a small company everyone can know what everyone else is working on and make sure that everything fits together and is optimally reused. In a larger company this can be much harder. On the flip side of this, big companies can get much greater economies of scale. They should be able to invest more in shared components and infrastructure that enable their employees to be more productive. But that often just doesn't happen because it's difficult to manage.
